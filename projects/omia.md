## Purpose

- To integrate 30+ years of records from the manually curated OMIA database into the international European Variation Archive (EVA), including resolving issues resulting from manual data entry.

## Approach

- My role was project management.
- I was the only person with both software and biology experience on the team, so I had to provide substantial communication "translation". 
- Regular check-ins via email and Zoom, with both local and international partners, facilitated the progress of this project.

## Outcome

- Records have been standardised (last bugfixes happening now) and will be part of the next EVA release.
