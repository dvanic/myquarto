## Purpose
- The clients have a partnership with Responsible Wagering Australia to provide experimental data for research.
- For this project, the questions were:
    1. What proportion of online sports wagerers use consumer protection tools (deposit limits, timeouts & self-exclusions)? 
    2. What are the differences between wagerers who use each of the tool types?

## Approach

- Integrated 12+ million online wagering transactions from 50 000 clients of 6 major online wagering operators. Engineered over 200 features for analysis.
- This revealed that mandatory vs opt-in deposit limits are likely to reduce the risk of harms.
- Created a visualisation for the tool use trajectory for ~3000 clients to enable data understanding and hypothesis generation, for the next work around understanding tool use patterns among users of multiple tools.

## Outcome
- Co-authored the first academic publication regarding consumer protection tool use among sports wagerers in Australia.
- Contributed to a report for Responsible Wagering Australia.
- Study results were covered by multiple media outlets (see below links).
