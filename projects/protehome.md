## Clients

- A large 50+ person laboratory from the University of Sydney's Faculty of Medicine & Health.


## Purpose

- To develop a software tool to store their [mass spectrometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_spectrometry) data.


## Challenges

- Data exists in spreadsheets on users laptops, with columns organised in various ad-hoc, manual ways
- Data can come from several distinct experiment types, with different "columns" being appropriate for each
- Data has been processed with different versions of the same software, and this needs to be recorded/captured
- Data has been processed to different versions of reference annotations, so old data needs to be automatically updated to reflect the changes that have happened in the annotation

## Approach

- My role was project management & user requirements elucidation.

- The tool ended up consisting of:
    - An interface to upload data and validate its integrity
    - Internal functionality to update the database records when [UniProt](https://www.uniprot.org/) (a publically available annotation database) was updated
    - A search interface


## Outcome

- As project manager, I ensured client needs were met within a reasonable time frame and the software was able to do what they wanted. 

- As domain matter expert, I served as a "translator" between the clients (biologists) and the two software engineers, as the ways/langauge of describing functionality and user needs was very different between the two. For example, a "UI" demonstration was confusing for the client, as much core functionality was still not operational, so it was unclear what they were being asked to provide feedback for.
