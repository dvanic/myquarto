## Purpose

- To use genetic markers and demographics to predict the need for oxygen among flu patients. 

## Approach

- My role was project management.
- The analyst used PCA & logistic regression + random forest models to explore the data and provide a prediction.
## Outcome

- Genetic markers & demographics could not predict the need for oxygen therapy among flu patients.
- My role was to communicate and resolve this negative result with the client.


## Key tools

- *git & GitHub; GitHub projects; Jira; Trello; Powerpoint*.
