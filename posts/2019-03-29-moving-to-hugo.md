I'm finally making the leap, and (hopefully) moving this website to blogdown + hugo + gitlab + netlify.

So far, useful resources for wrapping my head around how to do this:

- [Alison Presmanes Hill's documentation](https://alison.rbind.io/post/up-and-running-with-blogdown/)
- [Very useful gotcha for configuring Netlify](https://maraaverick.rbind.io/2017/10/updating-blogdown-hugo-version-netlify/)
- [Non-blogdown specific very detailed outlined (for future reference, when I want to add new page types)](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/)

Things that don't seem to work:

- Math! :sob: (but, hey, emoji do! :smile:)
- FontAwesome "social" icons apart from the default (but I think this is something I need to figure out)
